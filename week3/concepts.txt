1. Before any endpoint in a website is hit, there are some authorization checks to be made to make sure whatever is hitting the endpoint is valid and correct.
2. This is done by MIDDLE-WARE which does 2 things mainly {
    - Auth       : authorization of the request.
    - Validation : ensure that the config of user i/p req is valid.

    For example the hospital-kidney example harkirat took [
        1. user needs to send username and password in the header -> Auth.
        2. user needs to send kidney parameter either 1 or 2 (humans have max 2), if the user sends  1 > kidney >2 it is invalid -> Validation.
    ]
