DOM -> Javascript makes the HTML page active and dynamic via DOM.

The WHAT { MOTA MOTA LETS THE BACKEND TALK WITH THE FRONTEND i.e Making the frontend dynamic
    1. Programming interface for wen docs.
    2. It is not a programming language.
    3. WebAPI to make websites dynamic.
    4. It is language agnostic, its not a part of JS.
    5. Good concept -> locate the element | display the element | adding the text to the element 
}

Finding the HTML Elements {
    1. by ID - getElementById()
    2. by tagname - getElementsByTagname()
    3. class name - getElementsByClassName()
    4. css selectors
    5. html object collections

}

Sending requests automatically [THROTLING, DEBOUNCING] => basicDOM.html {
    1. Throtling -> To automatically send request to the server anytime the request body is changed.
    - Thortling -> onInput(function1() {})
    - But theres a problem if user sends 123 and 456 in the num1 and num2, then total 6 requests are sent to the server which are unnecessary.
    2. Debouncing -> Not sendig the request immediately while the req is changed but waiting for some time by adding a timer or something else.
