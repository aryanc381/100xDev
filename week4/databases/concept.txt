1. What are databases {
    - Where all user schema is stored.
    - Prisma / Mongoose is used to access these databases.
    - MongoDB is a popular database because it is free in nature and doesnt require schemas i.e it is schemaless.
    - Now this is also a problem, when user hits the database, any data can be obtained by only one request.
}

2. MongoDB & Express Servers {
    - This is why express servers are put in as the middleman to safeguard the main database.
    - Express Servers like Prisma and Mongoose are used to do this task.
    - They incorporate schemas so that the user is only able to access information that is present in the body of the schemas. 
    - express-schema.jpg has a visual representation of this.
}

3. Exception FIREBASE {
    - Firebase provides granular selection of objects directly in the database.
    - THis removes the need of express servers but I feel there might be some limitations to this.
}

4. Database Jargons {
    - Cluster  :  
    - Database :
    - Table    :
